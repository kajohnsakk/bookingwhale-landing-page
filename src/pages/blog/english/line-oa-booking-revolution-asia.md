## Introduction: The Asian Digital Communication Revolution

In the rapidly evolving digital landscape of Asia, communication patterns have fundamentally shifted. While the West relies heavily on email and SMS, Asia has embraced messaging apps as the primary form of business communication. Leading this revolution is LINE, with over 196 million monthly active users across key Asian markets.

For service businesses across Asia, this shift represents more than just a new communication channel—it's a complete reimagining of how customer relationships are built and maintained. LINE Official Account (LINE OA) integration with booking systems isn't just following a trend; it's becoming the new standard for customer engagement.
